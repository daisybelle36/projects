mkdir whisper
cd whisper
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# always a good idea to make sure pip is up-to-date
pip3 install --upgrade pip

Next, install a clone of the Whisper package and its dependencies (torch, numpy, transformers, tqdm, more-itertools, and ffmpeg-python) into your python environment.

pip3 install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# now run the script
time ~/github/projects/whisper/transcribe_audio.py ./*.mp3 > ../06_new.txt
